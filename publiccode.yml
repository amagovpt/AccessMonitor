    shortDescription: "AccessMonitor is an evaluation tool of the web content
      accessibility practices according to the WCAG 2.1 of W3C "
    longDescription: Does your website or digital service comply with European
      Standard EN 301 549? Does it meet the accessibility standards of the
      Accessibility Directive and the European Accessibility Act? AccessMonitor
      provides a first look at these questions. The automatic assessment of
      accessibility practices doesn't answer everything, but it's a good
      starting point. More than a police officer, AccessMonitor aims to be your
      educator of accessibility requirements. It reports errors, but also tells
      you what it found to be well-executed and what requires manual validation.
    features:
      - Generates a score from 1 to 10. How much are the accessibility practices
        found on the submitted web page worth?
      - Generates a report containing the good and the bad practices found on
        the submitted web page.
      - Evaluates a web page by submitting a URL, directly entering code, or
        uploading a file.
      - It is also available as an extension for Chrome/Edge which allows you to
        perform evaluations even on pages under login.
      - Evaluates WCAG 2.1 standard (includes all ACT Rules).
